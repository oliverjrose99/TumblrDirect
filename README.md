# Tumblr Direct
A Reddit bot written in Python which takes NSFW Tumblr posts and posts the direct links in the comments.
## Requirements
* Python 3
* PRAW
* BeautifulSoup4
## Why
Because people/bots post links on Reddit to Tumblr posts which, when opened, will either redirect to ads or the post will have ads around it. As soon as you click or even look at it funny, your PC/mobile will have aids, there will be horny single moms in your area and The Real Fuckbook will be back.
## Support Me
Server costs aren't a lot, ~£10 per month, but i'm currently unemployed so any support is greatly appreciated. If you want to support me in other ways then you can submit pull requests, find and/or fix bugs, etc. Again, any and all help is greatly appreciated
