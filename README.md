# Tumblr Direct
A Reddit bot written in Python which takes NSFW Tumblr posts and posts the direct links in the comments. It works for IFrames, videos, photosets and individual photos. 
## Requirements
* Python 3
* PRAW
* BeautifulSoup4
## Why
Because people/bots post links on Reddit to Tumblr posts which, when opened, will either redirect to ads or the post will have ads around it. As soon as you click or even look at it funny, your PC/mobile will have aids, there will be horny single moms in your area and The Real Fuckbook will be back.
